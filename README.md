# Bouncing Ball

demo:  https://gurunath-mca-23.github.io/Random-Ball/

# Project Description: 

This HTML document creates an interactive simulation of randomly colored bouncing balls within a rectangular container. JavaScript generates and animates these balls, applying gravity-like effects to make them bounce off the container's walls. The balls' positions, velocities, and colors are randomly generated, creating an engaging visual display.

# To Run the Project: 

Step1:Save the HTML file with a html extension

Step2 Click the "Go Live" button to open a new browser window displaying the Bouncing Ball animation.


# Future Improvement:

consider integrating user interaction like click-and-drag functionality, customizable ball properties, and physics-based interactions, such as ball collisions for a more engaging and interactive animation.
